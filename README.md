This is a Hackathon Winning Project. It consists of two applications, User-side and Admin-side for Canteen Management in Universities.

# Problem Statement

* In universities, during breaktime there is a lot of rush for food at canteen. 
* Moreover break time is limited so it is difficult for students and teachers to have their ordered food on time.
